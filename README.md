See What You Type Project Contains 2 HTML Elements one is a `textArea` and other is a `paragraph`. Basically Using JS What I accomplished is that what ever you type in the text area is reflected in real time to the paragraph empowered by DOM which is Document Object Model.

*NOTE That all the `HTML` & `CSS` Code is provided by iNeuron mentor and was given to me as a challenge to not alter the code and write js on top of it*

*Hope You Liked My Work
